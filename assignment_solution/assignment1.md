# Assignment 1

## 1.1 Iterated Best Response for simple matrix game

### Question 1

There is no dominated strategy.


### Question 2 ??

Columns user:

U: 1, 2, 6 -> 1 

M: 6, 1, -2 -> -2

D: 9, 0, 2 -> 0

Row user:

L, C, R

-1, -2, -6

-6, -1, 2

-9, 0, -2

 |  |   |

-9, -2, -6

Maxmin pay-off strategy:
1. column user first: U,L,U,L
2. row user first: C,U,CU

### Question 3 ???

change it to a game where there is NE.

## 1.2 Elimination of the dominated strategies

### Question 1

1. the max value of 2/3 of the mean m is 67.  The strategy that choose integer bigger than 67 is dominated strategy.
2. Since for every rational player, the max integer will be 67, then the max value of 2/3 of mean m will be samller than $\frac{2*67}{3}$
3. By eliminating the dominated strategy, the final answer is 1

### Question 2

No. The assumption of the above is that everyone is rational, however not everyone is rational. Choose between 0 and 67.


## 1.3 Cournot's Doupoly 

### Question 1

For company 1, the total revenue is:

$R = q_{1}(p-c_{1}) = -\beta q_{1}^{2}+(\alpha+-\beta q_{2} - c_{1})q_{1}$

$argmax_{q_{1}} = \frac{\alpha+-\beta q_{2} - c_{1}}{2\beta}$

Apply the same process on company 2:

$argmax_{q_{2}} = \frac{\alpha+-\beta q_{1} - c_{2}}{2\beta}$

### Question 2

Based on the above two equations, the final outcome will be:

$q_{1} = q_{2} + \frac{c_{2}-c_{1}}{\beta}$

## 1.4 Ice Cream Time

## Question 1
Assume the position of Charlize is $z$, then the influencing distance of Charlize is:

1. $z+\frac{x-z}{2} = 0.05+0.5z$ ($z \in [0, 0.1]$) => max value is 0.1
2. $\frac{y-x}{2}=0.35$ ($z \in [0.1, 0.8]$) => max value is $$
3. $\frac{z-y}{2} + 1-z$ ($z \in [0.8, 1]$)

Charlize can choose any location between x and y

## Question 2

1. $z+\frac{x-z}{2} = 0.05+0.5z$ ($z \in [0, 0.1]$) => max value is max1=0.1
2. $\frac{y-x}{2}=0.35$ ($z \in [0.1, 0.8]$) => max value is $max2=\frac{b-0.1}{2}$
3. $\frac{z-y}{2} + 1-z$ ($z \in [0.8, 1]$)  => max value is $max3=\frac{b+z}{2}$

Based on the below graph,

TODO: graph

1. when b<0.7 => position of b
2. when b>0.7 => any position between a and b

### Question 3 

b = 0.7

### Question 4 ??
